The commit command needs to cache the current staging area to `/tmp/`,
stage the db, and commit with a generated commit message based on db changes.
Should be something like `add issue: 0002` or
`add issues: 0004, 0005; edit issue: 0002` Ideally we could also have borzoi
deploy a git pre commit hook that makes sure the user has dealt with issues
related to the commit but idk how to do that besides just asking "have you
checked the issues?" or something.
