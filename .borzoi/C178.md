# Cat formatting
Right now we depend on issues formatting themselves, and things like italics
and bold aren't applied since we just print the body directly. What we *should*
do is keep the current behavior as a fallback (perhaps just adding super basic
word wrapping) add default to calling some kind of CLI markdown
parser/formatter. (Maybe bat?)

## Potential formatter options:
- ~`bat -plmd`~
- ~`rich -mW80 - 2>/dev/null`~
- ~`glow -w 80`~

## Chosen Solution:
[md4c](https://github.com/mity/md4c/) will now be a hard dependency. It's a very small library, so this should
be a non issue.
