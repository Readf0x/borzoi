Right now we depend on issues formatting themselves, and things like italics
and bold aren't applied since we just print the body directly. What we *should*
do is keep the current behavior as a fallback (perhaps just adding super basic
word wrapping) add default to calling some kind of CLI markdown
parser/formatter. (Maybe bat?)
