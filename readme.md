A CLI issue tracker that uses flat files

Borzoi [eats it's own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

This was inspired by [Tsoding's similar issue setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH6KOEVnSZA)

# Who is this for?
Borzoi is primarily designed for projects that do not have any kind of git
frontend or dedicated issue tracker. Issues are created by those with commit
access, and since they're a part of the repo, they are automatically distributed
along with the source code to anyone who's working on it.
